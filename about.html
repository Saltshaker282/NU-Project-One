After years of working with children on the Autism spectrum as a Line Therpaist, and later in hospital administration- I desired a change. Over the last year or two I came to realize that I really enjoyed helping to re-develop order sets for the Electronic Health Records system at my job in a hospital. That, combined with the fact that I love problem solving a good puzzle, led me to web development. With a field so wide-open to possibilities, I am confidnent that I will find my niche in an area that will not only be personally satifsfying but will also allow me to make a wider impact that reaches beyond myself.</p>

Ranging from my first job as a Little League Baseball Umpire, to being a Stage Hand, to being a Receptionist as a school, has given me a very wide range of talents, something I pride myself on. I'm a quick learner and a general, all-purpose individual who can function well-enough in any role, but can still specialize on any given set of skills, particularly when I truly set my mind to it. These are the qualities that I pride myself on within a professional environment, as well as hobbies and non- work-related activities, group or solo.</p>

I began my love of digital media at an early age using programs such as “KID PIX” and “Microsoft Paint” to draw and create. I’ve always had an interest in computers and what they can bring to society. I knew that was something I wanted my future job to involve. As a child, I enjoyed playing video games and working on computers. I thought about a career in the game design field, but quickly realized that programming languages were something I had very little interest in.</p>
