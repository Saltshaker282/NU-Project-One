# Our Purpose and Functionality
The *purpose* of our application is to create an animal index of different national parks in America.  It provides the most up to date information on animals located in each park.  The user will be able to see each animal's picture, scientific name, endagerment status etc.  A user can then use this information to decide which park to go to, which animals to look for while visiting the park, learn more about the animals they saw, or however they see fit.

The *functionality* of this application enables the user to access this application easily from their mobile device or their browser.  The user can select a national park and see the animals located within it.
