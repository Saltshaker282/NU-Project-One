    <!-- We want an input field at the top of the jumbotron for specific input
    -create a jumbotron at the top with an input field-based on location- by state 
    -using keywords, the search will then interact with a api/array- exact information to be determined
    -this information is then displayed back to the user in a card?
    -the header will likely remain consistent on both versions-->
